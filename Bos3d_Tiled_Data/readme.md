# Tiled Collections
The city model is made of several modular tiled collections.  For example, there is a collection of areial photo tiles that were captured in April 2021; a collection of groundplan tiles that were created from 2011 photogrammetry; tiled terrain models created form the same photogrammetric survey; and there is a collection of 3D building models for each tile.  The tield collections are grouped in folders.  Each of the tiled resources is identified by a file name that incorporates a descriptive name and the Tile ID.  Each collection/folder contains a catalog folder that includes a metadata document that describes the data-set and the tiling scheme.  The catalog is designed as an archival exchange package that has enough information necessary for application developers and archivists to systematically access and re-use the assetts.
