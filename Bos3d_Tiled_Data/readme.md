# Tiled Collections
The city model is made of several modular tiled collections.  For example, there is a collection of areial photo tiles that were captured in April 2021; a collection of groundplan tiles that were created from 2011 photogrammetry; tiled terrain models created form the same photogrammetric survey; and there is a collection of 3D building models for each tile.  The tiled collections are grouped in folders.  Each of the folders and the individual tiled resources are identified by a file name that incorporates a descriptive name. Names for individual files incorpoerate the Tile ID.  

Each collection/folder contains a catalog folder that includes a metadata document that describes the provenance of the data-set and the specifics of the tiling scheme and coordinate system.  The catalog also includes a manifest in JSON format that provides an end-point of bitstream for each of the individual components. In the case of 3D model components, each asset is also[packaged with a JSON file that serves to identify the individual resource. 

The tiled collections and their catalog are designed as an archival exchange package that includes sufficient information for application developers and archivists to systematically access and re-use the assets.
